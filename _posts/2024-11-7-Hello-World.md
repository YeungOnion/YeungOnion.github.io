title: gh-pages and Jekyll

The canonical hello, but this time in [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io).
Don't think I'll learn this one for a bit since I'm not really into this kind of thing, but its reminiscent of Go syntax and seems like it knows its use case - integrations, connect between APIs over networks with a source-diagram bijection supporting visual abstractions.
Perhaps I'll find something fun to do with it at some point.

```bal
import ballerina/io;

public function main() {
    io:println("Hello, World!");
}
```

Figured I didn't have the public content to migrate the blog, so I simply restarted. We're on gh-pages and we're on Jekyll, because Rails is cool again and this might expose me to Ruby.
